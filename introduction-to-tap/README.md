# Introduction To TAP

The Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) is a robust Developer Platform built on Kubernetes, designed to address various challenges faced by modern software development teams. These challenges include the complexities of managing resources, ensuring application security, and adapting to constantly evolving software architecture.

TAP provides practical solutions to these obstacles by streamlining the development process, promoting the "shift left" paradigm, and enabling the creation of a secure supply chain. By abstracting the underlying infrastructure, TAP makes it easily consumable by application teams, which reduces the time and effort needed to deploy and manage applications.

Furthermore, TAP supports the development of an internal developer platform (IDP), allowing organizations to tailor their development environment to their specific needs. For more information on the concept of platform engineering and the importance of an IDP, visit https://platformengineering.org/blog/what-is-platform-engineering.

By addressing these concerns and offering a comprehensive solution, TAP empowers software development teams to focus on innovation and productivity, ultimately contributing to the overall success of their organization.
