# Unofficial Guide To TAP

This guide is designed to cater to two primary audiences: Platform engineers and application teams.

Platform engineers are responsible for building developer platforms and are expected to have a solid foundation in Kubernetes to follow the instructions in this guide.

On the other hand, application teams consist of Developers, app owners, and app operators who collaborate on the development, deployment, and maintenance of applications. While it is helpful, they don't need to bring any specific K8s knowledge as TAP is designed to provide an abstraction layer on top of Kubernetes.

To ensure a seamless learning experience, the guide's structure provides a single learning path tailored to each persona. By incorporating task-based guides that readers can follow along with, we hope to ease the process of understanding and mastering TAP for both Platform Engineers and Application Teams.

## Disclaimer

This guide is supposed to help people build and use a developer platform built with TAP. The focus on learning means we will sometimes sacrifice technical correctness and/or completeness of information in favor it didactics.
