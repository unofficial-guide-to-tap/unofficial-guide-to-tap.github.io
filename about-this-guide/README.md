# About This Guide

Motivation often plays a crucial role in one's ability to grasp new concepts or technologies. In the case of the Tanzu Application Platform (TAP), the lack of easily accessible and digestible learning material has presented a significant barrier to entry. The available documentation has proven to be challenging to consume, while the TAP system itself is recognized for its steep learning curve and complex nature.

With this in mind, the book is designed to cater to two primary audiences: Platform Engineers and Application Teams. Platform Engineers are responsible for building developer platforms and are expected to have a solid foundation in Kubernetes. On the other hand, Application Teams consist of Developers, App Owners, and App Operators who collaborate on the development, deployment, and maintenance of applications.

To ensure a seamless learning experience, the book's structure provides a single learning path tailored to each persona. By incorporating task-based guides that readers can follow along with, we hope to ease the process of understanding and mastering TAP for both Platform Engineers and Application Teams.
