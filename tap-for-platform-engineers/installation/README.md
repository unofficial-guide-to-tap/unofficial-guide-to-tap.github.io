# Installation

## Minimal
In this guide, we strive to give a to-the-point installation guide that requires the reader to run a minimum number of steps to get TAP up and running. All advanced installation topics will be covered in subsequent chapters that build on exactly this minimal installation.

## Jump host
All installation steps are designed to be run from an **Ubuntu** jump host where applicable for the following reasons:

1. **Consistency**: We want to provide the exact command to be used for a certain step. Maintaining that across all possible operating systems a reader my be installing from, is not manageable for us at this point. 

2. **Speed**: While not strictly part of a minimal installation, we include steps to mirror the package repositories which creates a significant amount of traffic. Running this from a jump host in the datacenter or public cloud will tremendously speed up the installation experience.
