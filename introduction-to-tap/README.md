VMware Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) is a development platform that facilitates building and deploying cloud-native applications on any compliant public cloud or on-premises Kubernetes cluster. TAP streamlines the developer experience and allows developers to quickly build and test applications, regardless of their familiarity with Kubernetes. It automates source-to-production pipelines and encourages collaboration between developers and operators.

TAP simplifies workflows in the inner loop (development cycle) and outer loop (deployment and maintenance) of Kubernetes-based app development. Operations teams can create application scaffolding templates with built-in security and compliance guardrails. Supply chains, a feature of TAP, codify the steps necessary for applications to reach production or lower environments, unifying access points for tools and enabling smoother integration.

Tanzu Application Platform provides a default set of components to automate app deployment to staging and production on Kubernetes. This alleviates pain points in both inner and outer loops and allows operators to customize the platform with other products.

VMware Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) is a comprehensive solution designed to enable the development, deployment, and management of modern, cloud-native applications. By incorporating key principles such as Shift Left, Secure Software Supply Chain, Abstraction of Infrastructure, and DevSecOps, TAP aims to simplify the application lifecycle and improve collaboration between developers and IT operations teams.

- Shift Left: TAP emphasizes the "Shift Left" approach, which involves identifying and addressing potential issues early in the software development lifecycle. This helps reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with fixing problems that may arise later in the process. By integrating testing, security, and compliance into the development process, TAP enables teams to build high-quality applications faster.

- Modern Applications: TAP focuses on supporting modern application architectures, such as microservices and containers, which offer increased scalability, resilience, and flexibility. The platform provides the necessary tools and services to streamline the deployment and management of these applications in Kubernetes environments across different infrastructure types, including on-premises, public cloud, and edge locations.

- Secure Software Supply Chain: Ensuring a secure software supply chain is a crucial aspect of TAP. The platform offers a curated catalog of open-source components that are continuously maintained for security and compliance, reducing potential risks associated with third-party libraries. The Tanzu Build Service automates container image creation using cloud-native buildpacks, further enhancing application security and consistency.

- Abstraction of Infrastructure: TAP abstracts the underlying infrastructure, enabling developers to focus on writing code while the platform takes care of deploying and managing applications in various environments. With the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, TAP provides a consistent Kubernetes distribution that simplifies the deployment and management of clusters, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

- DevSecOps: TAP incorporates DevSecOps principles, which foster a culture of collaboration between development, security, and operations teams. This integration results in faster, more secure application delivery. Tools like Tanzu Observability and Tanzu Service Mesh provide real-time insights into application and infrastructure performance, simplifying monitoring, troubleshooting, and securing microservices running on Kubernetes.

By leveraging these principles, VMware Tanzu Application Platform empowers organizations to embrace modern application development practices, accelerate digital transformation, and deliver secure, high-quality applications.
