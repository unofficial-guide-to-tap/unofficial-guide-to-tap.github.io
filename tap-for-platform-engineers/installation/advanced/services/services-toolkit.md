# Services Toolkit

## Compatibility

At this point, you should have successfully installed and tested one of the extensions that allow you to lifecycle service instances from Kubernetes. If not, [go back](README.md) to check your options. Having deployed at least one service instance, in order to continue, you will need a [Service Binding](https://servicebinding.io/) compatible resource to represent it. Check [here](https://servicebinding.io/service-provider/) for details on what that means.

While some Kubernetes extensions provide service binding compatible resources, you need to perform a few extra steps for those that don't:

- [Config Connector Compatibility](./services-toolkit-config-connector-compatiblity.md)

Before you proceed, make sure you have service binding compatible representation of a service instance in Kubernetes.
